# RAPID
Sensor data pre- and post-processing scripts from RAPID (Robust Autonomous Pressure and Inertial Devices).

Current code supports RAPID, EU FITHydro Barotrauma Detection System (BDS) sensors and fish backpacks for the reduction of live fish testing through science and technology (RETERO). 

MATLAB 2022a

## Examples

Several examples are provided in the `data/` folder to run the RAPID scripts, located in the `examples/` folder.

Download an example file and run from MATLAB:

    [dataOut, xq, RMSE] = interpolateRegFcn(dataIn, nOut, interpMethod)
